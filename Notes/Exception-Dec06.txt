Exception:

//An abnormal event occurs during run time. this cause the program to stop immediately

//Whenever exception occurs ,an object which is related to the exception will be thrown (by jvm )to the user. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------

//Checked Exception - Compile Time Exception
		
		//Checked Exception will be Handled at compileTime


//UnChecked Exception  - Runtime Exception 
				
		//UnChecked Exception will be handled at Runtime



//Try block should be accompanied with catch or finally block


//catch block of Exception(Parent class for all Exception) must be placed in end of the all other catch block


---------------------------------------------------------------------


Checked Exception (Compile-Time Exception)

These are the exceptions checked by the compiler.

Java forces you to handle them using try/catch or declare using throws.

If you don’t handle them → Compilation Error.

Examples:

IOException

SQLException

ClassNotFoundException

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Unchecked Exception (Runtime Exception)

These exceptions occur during runtime.

Compiler does not force you to handle them.

They are subclasses of RuntimeException.

Examples:

ArithmeticException

NullPointerException

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException


---------------------------------------------------------------------


Rule: try block must be followed by catch or finally

Valid:

try { }
catch(Exception e) { }


Valid:

try { }
finally { }


Valid:

try { }
catch(Exception e) { }
finally { }


Invalid:

try { }   // No catch or finally → Compile-time error


---------------------------------------------------------------------


Rule: catch blocks should be ordered from specific → general

Because Java checks catch blocks in order.


Wrong (Parent placed before Child)
try { }
catch(Exception e) { }  
catch(ArithmeticException e) { } // ERROR: unreachable


Correct (Child first, Parent next)
try { }
catch(ArithmeticException e) { }  
catch(Exception e) { }


Reason:
Exception is the parent class of all exceptions.
If placed first, child catches become unreachable → Compile-time error.
