//Polymorphism  ---? manyForms

//Polymorphism means performing the same action in different ways

//It has two types: 

//             --> method overriding(Runtime Polymorphism):
							//same method name 
							//same parameter 
							//with different definition 
							//happenings between parent and child classes
							//Child class provides its own version of the method
//Can we have same method name in parent and child class - yes we can do

//for Different own definition --it's called method overriding   




//             --> method overLoading(Compile-time Polymorphism):
							//same method name with no.of arguments or different arguments
							//Happening in same class



//Abstract - Hiding unwanted details , Showing only necessary information

//			If a class contains at least one abstract method, The whole class must be declared abstract.

//			Have no body ,CAN be overridden in the child class

//          Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces

//abstract - is a keyword    --> Data Hiding
